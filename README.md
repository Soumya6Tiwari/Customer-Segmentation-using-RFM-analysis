## Introduction

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize their marketing strategies and enhance customer relationships. This project uses RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling more personalized and effective marketing efforts.

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to accurately identify and target their most valuable customers. Without a clear understanding of customer behavior, companies may resort to broad, untargeted marketing efforts, resulting in lower engagement, reduced retention, and missed revenue opportunities. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a method to segment customers based on:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases.
- **Monetary**: How much a customer spends.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Acquiring and preparing transactional data for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data, handling missing values, and performing outlier analysis.
3. **RFM Scoring**: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values and assigning scores to customers.
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Using the K-Means algorithm to group customers into segments based on their RFM scores.
5. **Insights and Analysis**: Deriving actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For K-Means clustering and other machine learning tasks.
- **Flask**: For backend development.
- **React**: For frontend development.

## Results

- Segmented customers into different groups using K-Means clustering based on their RFM scores.
- Identified high-value customers for targeted marketing efforts.
- Provided actionable insights to improve customer retention and boost business growth.

## Future Scope

- Implementation of advanced modeling techniques for more precise segmentation.
- Integration of real-time segmentation and analysis.
- Connecting the system with CRM tools for automated and efficient customer relationship management.
